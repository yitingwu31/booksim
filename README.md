Deterministic Routing with Genetic Algorithm on BookSim
=========================================

This work focuses on the potential of using the genetic algorithm (GA) to explore possible routes and converge to an optimal routing solution in Network-on-Chip routing. 

We implemented GA logistics with Python scripts and ran the simulation on BookSim.

BookSim is a cycle-accurate interconnection network simulator.
Originally developed for and introduced with the [Principles and Practices of Interconnection Networks](http://cva.stanford.edu/books/ppin/) book, its functionality has since been continuously extended.
The current major release, BookSim 2.0, supports a wide range of topologies such as mesh, torus and flattened butterfly networks, provides diverse routing algorithms and includes numerous options for customizing the network's router microarchitecture.
